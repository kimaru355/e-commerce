      "description": "iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to feature an aerospace‑grade titanium design, using the same alloy that spacecraft use for missions to Mars. Titanium has one of the best strength‑to‑weight ratios of any metal, making these our lightest Pro models ever. You’ll notice the difference the moment you pick one up. The biggest redesign in the history of Apple GPUs. A17 Pro is an entirely new class of iPhone chip that delivers our best graphics performance by far. Mobile games will look and feel so immersive, with incredibly detailed environments and more realistic characters. And with industry-leading speed and efficiency, A17 Pro takes fast and runs with it. The 48MP Main camera is more advanced than ever, capturing super‑high‑resolution photos with a new level of detail and color. iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to support USB 3, for a huge leap in data transfer speeds and faster pro workflows than ever before. All‑new Wi‑Fi 6E delivers up to two times faster wireless speeds. So you can upload and download files in a flash.",
